## Fullstack developer position

### The position

We are constantly developing and refactoring our existing IoT platform, agent management tool, payment collection engine, and agent app. As a fullstack engineer you will be required to input on all of these projects, and work closely with other team members to build cohesive, maintainable and scalable systems.

### Tech stack

#### Backend

* AWS
* Django
* Python
* MySQL
* Docker

#### Frontend

* Vue.js
* JavaScript
* Quasar
* Android Studio

#### Tools & IDE

* VS Code
* PyCharm
* WebStorm
* Bitbucket
* New Relic

The current stack revolves around AWS, Django and Vue.js. We really like the power, scalability and dynamic nature of python. We appreciate the large python community and thing that it is a very suitable tool for your needs. We are excited about the elegance and rapid growth of Vue and have decided to take it on as our JS framework of choice.

We have decided to embrace hybrid apps as a way to keep the team nimble, and we are using a Cordova and Quasar to build mobile tools for our agents.

This position would involve contributing to the frontend architecture and standards of the organization. We think frontend deserves the same emphasis, quality and consideration as the rest of the stack. We want to include automated tests (Jasmine, Mocha) and integration tests (Selenium) as well as a holistic "dev-ops" approach which would involve cloudfront, S3 and cloud-formation.

The current platform manages a IoT system of fire detectors that prevent fires in informal settlements across South Africa, as well as managing insurance agents that operate in these communities - offering the first of its kind household insurance for people living in informal settlements.

It is an exciting position that would include working with an array of technologies, a position that you can make your own, in a team that is passionate and inclusive. Your technical decisions to have a large impact on the system - you will be contributing massively to a live saving technology, and a system that hopes to improve financial inclusion in South Africa and the world.

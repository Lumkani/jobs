# Vue Architecture Patterns

Welcome to Lumkani's documentation for our best practices for writing Vue code! Here you will find everything from *"How to create components"* to *"Logic composition"*

## Getting started

We want to start a culture where we can share new ideas and we want our Vue applications to evolve over time. We can achieve this by contributing to this document through an **RFC process**, so if you have an idea that might be better than what we are using then don't be shy and submit an RFC :smile:

# Vue Architecture Patterns

Welcome to Lumkani's documentation for our best practices for writing Vue code! Here you will find everything from *"How to create components"* to *"Logic composition"*

## Getting started

We want to start a culture where we can share new ideas and we want our Vue applications to evolve over time. We can achieve this by contributing to this document through an **RFC process**, so if you have an idea that might be better than what we are using then don't be shy and submit an RFC :smile:

### What is an RFC?

An RFC means *Request for Comment* which is the process of submitting an idea to the team with an outlined example and problems being solved.

:::tip
Here is an example of an RFC: [BaseInput Component](/RFCs/#baseinput)

### How do I submit and RFC?

It's pretty simple! This is how you do it:

1. Clone this repo
2. Create a branch using this pattern: `rfc/<name-of-your-rfc>`
2. Look for the folder `/RFCs`
3. Create a markdown file with the name of your RFC `<the-best-rfc-ever>.md` in `/RFCs` folder
4. Submit your RFC via a pull request

That's basically it! Easy right? :muscle:
